RLHF_for_story_generation
This repository contains the code for using the GPT-2 to generate stylisic story based on RLHF

Dataset
Our dataset contains five-sentence stories from ROCStories corpus (Note that we just split the training data of the original corpus into the new training/validation/testing set). As for the knowledge bases, we used ConceptNet and ATOMIC. We made delexilization for all the resources as indicated in Section 4.1 of our paper. The processed dataset is available here. The fake stories used for multi-task learning can be generated by executing python3 gen_fake_st.py under the directory of data .

Pretrained model
The approach to downloading the pretrained model can be found on Hugging Face. We adopted the small-version of GPT-2.

details
You should first use the datasets to finetune a GPT2 generation model and a GPT2 classifier model.
And then run the trainer.py.
